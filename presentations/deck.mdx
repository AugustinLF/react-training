## React, rethinking best-practices
Separation of technologies !== separation of concerns

---
## F(D) = V
Your view is nothing but a pure function of data

---
## Let's see some React code

---
## JSX
```jsx
<div className="app">
  {getTitle()}
  <div>{shouldShowTitle && <Title />}</div>
  {type === 'reminder' ? <Reminder /> : <Other />}
  <ul>
    {[0, 1].map((count) => <li key={count}>{count}</li>)}
  </ul>
</div>
```

---
## JSX
```jsx
<div className="app">
  <Component
    active
    used={false}
    name="two"
    id={3}
  />
</div>
```

---
## Styling
But how do we make things pretty?

---
## Let's render something

---
## React API

---
## Reconciliation
Do React rerenders everything all the time?


---
## Further with React

---
## Events
React events are pretty close from the DOM ones, with a bit of cross-browser normalization and the fact that they are pooled.

---
## Forms
In React, the common way to use form elements is to control them.

---
## Controlled component
```jsx
    class Name extends React.Component {
        state = {value: ''};
        handleChange = (event) => {
          this.setState({value: event.target.value});
        }
        render() {
          return <input
                    type="text"
                    value={this.state.value}
                    onChange={this.handleChange}
                />;
        }
    }
```

---
## Refs
A way to do imperative action on a component (call a function on it for instance), or access the DOM generated by a component.

---
## Higher Order Components
A function that takes a Component and returns a new one

It's just a wrapper around a component

---
## Function as a child component
children is nothing but a normal prop

---
## Context
A way to pass data from an upper to a lower one, without having to do it through each children of the hierarchy.

---
## Context
```jsx
  const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue);

  <Provider value={/* some value */}>{...}</Provider>

  <Consumer>
    {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
  </Consumer>
```

## Practice
- Pair Programming: switch every 15 minutes
- The solutions are in the repo. Please don't check them.
- Call one of us to validate each step.
