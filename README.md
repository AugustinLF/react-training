Inspiration:
  - [@mjackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson)'s talk [Rendering with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S8v8jfLb1Q)
  - [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)'s [react-workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-workshop)
  - [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)'s [egghead course on Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
