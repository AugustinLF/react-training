## Javascript
Not being fluent with ES2015/2016, and not comfortable with pure array manipulation techniques (`.map`, `.filter`, `.reducer`) hurts a lot when using React, and you should first focus on that.
- Wes Bos did a great series with [30 exercices in 30 days](https://javascript30.com/) to level up in JavaScript
- [ES2016 in depth](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/es6-in-depth)

## Functional Programming (FP)
- [Composition over inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA): really cool video (you can check everything he did) on the differences between inheritance and composition
- [Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide). Free ebook on the concepts of FP (from broad concepts (function composition, pointfree programming, declarative) to category theory (maybes, monads, etc.))
- Eric Eliott writes a lot of cool blog posts about JavaScript in general, but focuses mainly about the benefits of FP on [Medium](https://medium.com/@_ericelliott/latest), for instance:
    - [10 interview questions every javascript developer should know](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95#.w7316qunx)
    - [What is a closure?](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-closure-b2f0d2152b36#.rg6t8we4i)
    - [What is a function composition?](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-function-composition-20dfb109a1a0#.vgoz73la0)
    - [What is a pure function?](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976#.oelpkwny1)
    - [Difference between class and prototype](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-s-the-difference-between-class-prototypal-inheritance-e4cd0a7562e9#.k2uzqxk9c)

## React & Redux
- Dan Abramov did a great and free intro course on [redux on egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux). I heavily used it as a starting point for the Redux course

## What we used
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (this abstract webpack, babel, the configuration of the test runner)

## Interesting libraries in the ecosystem
- [ImmutableJS](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) immutable data structures
- [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/) your functional lodash
- [Flow](http://flowtype.org) static type analysis
- [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr/)
- [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
- CSS in JS ([fela](https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela), [styled-components](http://styled-components.com/))
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) (would replace Redux, less verbose, more magic)
- [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org) a redux middleware using RxJS to handle your async data-flow

## Good react components
- [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- [react-select](http://jedwatson.github.io/react-select/)
- [victory](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) a cool graph library
- [react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) for animation
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) cool set of components

## Testing
- [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) as a test runner (the one used during the training)
- [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) to assert/manipulate a component output
- [Snapshots](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html#content) as an efficient and simple way to prevent components regressions

## Alternatives to React
- [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/): a framework built over React to abstract server-side rendering, routing, build, etc.
- [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) a faster and smaller alternative to React that uses the same API (with some trade off)
