# Let's create a simple contact list

## Rendering to the DOM
Render
State for rendering empty list
fake async for data ?


To keep in mind? Does this component is supposed to handle that? Is it its responsibility?
A component should do only one thing

In the solution, the most logic you can find in a component are :
    .map
    conditional render (handling nullable)
    ternary
    (ok, and app, state handling)
